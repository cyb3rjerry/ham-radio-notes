## Basics of electricity and resistance

### Intro

[IPR-4](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2016/isde-ised/Iu64-45-3-2014-fra.pdf)
is the Canadian reference for which bands are available for which license.

### Electricity

- 5.2.1: Gold, silver and copper are good conductors.
- 5.2.2: Materials such as glass, porcelain, rubber, plastic and wood are good insulators.
- 5.2.4: The most used condutor is copper.
- 5.2.5: Material that conduct electricity well are called conductors.
- 5.2.6: Material that conduct electricity poorly are called insulators.
- 5.2.8: The opposite of resistance is conductance.
- 5.11.5: The instance of a magnetic field in a free space is directly proportional
to the intensity of the current flowing through the conductor.
- 5.11.7: In a conductor, the induced tension is perpendicular to the magnetic
field andto the direction of the current.
- 5.11.9: All magnets have a north and south pole. North and south poles
attract each other, while poles of the same type repel each other.
- 5.11.10: A permanent magnet is typically made of iron.

### Resistance

- 4.6.1: The fourth band represents the tolerance of the resistor.
- 4.6.2: The 3 first color bands on a resistor represent the value
of the resistor represented in ohms.
- 4.6.3: The first band represents the first digit of the value of the resistor.
The second band represents the second digit of the value of the resistor.
The third band represents the number of zeros to add to the value of the resistor.
The fourth band represents the tolerance of the resistor.
- 4.6.4: The actual resistance will typically be within 5%, 10% and
sometimes 20% of the value of the resistor.
- 4.6.5: The resistance of a resistor is represented by a color code.
- 4.6.6: Resistance of great quality will typically only vary by 0.1%.
- 4.6.7: When using an LED, the real resistance doesn't matter much.
20% is typically fine.
- 4.6.8: When a carbon resistor is heated, it's resistance increases.
The resistance changes based on it's heat coefficient.
- 4.6.9: Gold typically indicates a 5% tolerance.
Silver typically indicates a 10% tolerance. No band typically indicates a 20% tolerance.
- 4.6.10: The third band will, for example,
distinguish a 100ohm resistor from a 1000ohm resistor.
- 5.2.3: When a resistor gets hot, it means it's dissipating energy.
- 5.2.7: Resistance is measured in ohms. It's represented by the omega symbol.
- 5.2.10: The resistance of a conductor varies with it's heat.
- 5.2.11: The most used resistance is the carbon resistor.
- 5.5.3: When in parallel within a circuit, the total resistance is lower than
the lowest resistance of the resistors in parallel.
- 5.5.5: Resistors in series are added together.
- 5.5.6: For example, 5 10ohm resistors in series will have a total resistance
of 50ohms.
- 5.5.7: For example, 5 24ohm resistors in series will have a total resistance
of 120ohms.
- 5.5.8: When multiple resistors are in parallel and have the same value,
the total resistance formula is `Rt = R / n` where `R` is the resistance and
`n` is the number of resistors. When they are not of the same value, the
formula is `Rt = (r1 * r2)/(r1 + r2)`.
- 5.5.9: For example, a total of 4 68ohms resistors in parallel will have a
total resistance of 17ohms.
- 5.6.1: When we need to dissipate energy has heat, it's best to pick a
larger resistor even if a smaller one has the same ohmic value.
- 5.6.10: There's also an advantage to replacing a 50ohm resistor with two 100ohm
resistors in parallel. The power of the circuit will be higher
despite the same ohmic value.
- 5.6.11: The power rating of a resistors is based on it's ability to dissipate
heat.
